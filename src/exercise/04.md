# Capitalize the first letter of each word in a string

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each word
is capitalized. For example, the string "a short sentence" would be converted to
"A Short Sentence". Another example: "a lazy fox" would be converted to "A Lazy
Fox".
