# Vowel Count

In this exercise, you will write a function that takes a string as input and
returns the number of vowels in the string. Note that here is the list of
vowels: `['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y']`.

For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be 2. for "hello wOrld",
the output should be 3.
